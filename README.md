Unity Game Bengali Language Converter

# Overview


Bengali: A Global Language in the Gaming Industry

Bengali is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. With 250 million native speakers and an additional 40 million people using it as a second language, it plays a significant role in global communication.

However, in the gaming industry, which boasts 3.09 billion players worldwide, Bengali-speaking gamers often face a challenge. Many popular games are not available in Bengali, primarily because the widely-used Unity game engine does not fully support the language. As a result, many Bengali characters are not displayed correctly, making it difficult for players to enjoy games in their native language.

To address this issue, we have developed a converter that enables the creation of Bengali-language-based games, including all in-game instructions, quizzes, rules, and more. Our solution ensures that Bengali-speaking gamers can have a smooth and engaging experience, free from language barriers.
